\usage{
geom_half_violin(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, stat = "half_ydensity",
  position = "dodge", ..., side = "l", nudge = 0,
  draw_quantiles = NULL, trim = TRUE, scale = "area",
  na.rm = FALSE, show.legend = NA, inherit.aes = TRUE)

stat_half_ydensity(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, geom = "half_violin",
  position = "dodge", ..., bw = "nrd0", adjust = 1,
  kernel = "gaussian", trim = TRUE, scale = "area", na.rm = FALSE,
  show.legend = NA, inherit.aes = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link[=aes]{aes()}} or
\code{\link[=aes_]{aes_()}}. If specified and \code{inherit.aes = TRUE} (the
default), it is combined with the default mapping at the top level of the
plot. You must supply \code{mapping} if there is no plot mapping.}

\item{data}{The data to be displayed in this layer. There are three
options:

If \code{NULL}, the default, the data is inherited from the plot
data as specified in the call to \code{\link[=ggplot]{ggplot()}}.

A \code{data.frame}, or other object, will override the plot
data. All objects will be fortified to produce a data frame. See
\code{\link[=fortify]{fortify()}} for which variables will be created.

A \code{function} will be called with a single argument,
the plot data. The return value must be a \code{data.frame}, and
will be used as the layer data. A \code{function} can be created
from a \code{formula} (e.g. \code{~ head(.x, 10)}).}

\item{stat}{Use to override the default connection between
\code{geom_violin} and \code{stat_ydensity}.}

\item{position}{Position adjustment, either as a string, or the result of
a call to a position adjustment function.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed on to \code{\link[=layer]{layer()}}. These are
often aesthetics, used to set an aesthetic to a fixed value, like
\code{colour = "red"} or \code{size = 3}. They may also be parameters
to the paired geom/stat.}

\item{side}{The side on which to draw the half violin plot. "l" for left, "r" for right, defaults to "l".}

\item{nudge}{Add space between the violinplot and the middle of the space allotted to a given factor on the x-axis.}

\item{draw_quantiles}{If \code{not(NULL)} (default), draw horizontal lines
at the given quantiles of the density estimate.}

\item{trim}{If \code{TRUE} (default), trim the tails of the violins
to the range of the data. If \code{FALSE}, don't trim the tails.}

\item{scale}{if "area" (default), all violins have the same area (before trimming
the tails). If "count", areas are scaled proportionally to the number of
observations. If "width", all violins have the same maximum width.}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{FALSE}, the default, missing values are removed with
a warning. If \code{TRUE}, missing values are silently removed.}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
\code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.
It can also be a named logical vector to finely select the aesthetics to
display.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics,
rather than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions
that define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from
the default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link[=borders]{borders()}}.}

\item{geom}{Use to override the default connection between
\code{geom_violin} and \code{stat_ydensity}.}

\item{bw}{The smoothing bandwidth to be used.
If numeric, the standard deviation of the smoothing kernel.
If character, a rule to choose the bandwidth, as listed in
\code{\link[stats:bw.nrd]{stats::bw.nrd()}}.}

\item{adjust}{A multiplicate bandwidth adjustment. This makes it possible
to adjust the bandwidth while still using the a bandwidth estimator.
For example, \code{adjust = 1/2} means use half of the default bandwidth.}

\item{kernel}{Kernel. See list of available kernels in \code{\link[=density]{density()}}.}

\description{
A violin plot is a compact display of a continuous distribution. It is a
blend of [geom_boxplot()] and [geom_density()]: a
violin plot is a mirrored density plot displayed in the same way as a
boxplot.
